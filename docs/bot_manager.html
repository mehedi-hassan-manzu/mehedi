                And instantly, the editor of the Flow Builder will appear. The
                editor is divided into two parts – doc menu and editor. On the
                doc menu, all the components are gathered together. And on the
                editor, the Start Bot Flow component is already present.
              </p>
              <p>
                To build a bot, you have to drag components from the doc menu
                and drop them on the editor. Then you have to configure the
                components and connect them to each other. On the Doc menu,
                there are 13 components.

              </div>

              <p>
                On the Editor, you will see an element called start bot flow.
                This component is essential to building the bot. Double-click on
                the Start bot Flow element and the Right Sidebar called
                Configure Reference will appear with two fields – Title and
                Choose Labels. In the title field, give a title for the bot.
              </p>

              <p>
                And in the Choose labels field, you can select a label from a
                drop-down menu of different predefined fields. You can select
                multiple labels in the Choose labels field. If you don’t have
                any predefined fields, you can create labels here. To create a
                label, put the name for a label and press Enter button on your
                keyboard. Instantly, a label will be created and selected. Of
                course, you can select a sequence in the choose sequence field,
                though it is optional, not mandatory. Now click on the Ok button
                and the information will be added to the element.
              </p>

              <hr />
              <div class="section-header">
                <h1 id="trigger">Trigger Component</h1>
              </div>

              <p>
                The Trigger component is necessary if you want to start the bot
                with keywords. To set the trigger component, add the trigger
                component from the doc-menu and drop it on the editor. Now
                connect the trigger bot with the start bot flow component. Now
                double-click on the trigger component and a sidebar called
                configure trigger will appear. Now provide your comma-separated
                keywords in the field.
              </p>

              <p>
                And when a user writes something in the messaging window of your
                bot a, if the user word or words matches the keyboard, the bot
                will start. Then you will see two options- Exact keyboard match
                and String match. By default, the exact match is selected by
                default. As for the exact keyword match, if the keyword matches
                exactly, the bot will start. Otherwise not. For example, if a
                keyword is an apple and the user writes the word apple exactly,
                the bot will start. On the other hand, as for the string match
                keyword, if the word user write a word that matches partially,
                the bot will reply. For example, if the keyword is apple and the
                user writes apples, the bot will start. But if the keyword is
                apple and the user writes ‘app’ the bot will not start.
              </p>

              <p>
                Well, after providing comma-separated keywords and selecting an
                option, click on the ok button. And the keywords will appear on
                the component.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now connect the Trigger Keywords component with the Start Bot
                Flow component.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">
                <h1 id="add-components-without-docmenu">
                  Add components without dragging from doc-menu
                </h1>
              </div>

              <p>
                You can also add components without dragging the component from
                the Doc-menu and dropping it on the editor. From the sockets of
                any component, drag the cursor and drop it on the editor.
              </p>

              <p>
                In most cases, instantly a menu of the different components and
                a cancel button will appear. And from the menu, select a
                component and the component will appear on the editor connected
                with the mother component. And if you want to dismiss the
                drop-down menu without selecting a component, click on the
                Cancel Button.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, if you drag from the next output socket of the text
                component, a drop-down menu of different components — Text,
                Image, Video, Audio, File, Ecommerce, User Input Flow and Cancel
                button. Now from the drop-down menu, select your desired
                component. And if you want to dismiss the drop-down menu click
                on the Cancel button.
              </p>

              />

              <p>
                On the other hand, in some cases, instead of drop-down menu of
                different components, singe component will appear connected with
                the mother component.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, if you drage from the button output socket of the
                text component, and drop it on the editor, then the inline
                button component will appear on the editor connected with the
                mother component.

              <p>
                To build a condition-based Intelligent bot, just drag the
                condition component from the doc-menu and drop it on the editor.
                Now double-click on the condition element. Instantly, a form
                field will appear on the left side of the editor. At the top of
                the form field, you will see two radio buttons-- All Match and
                Any Match. And you have to select All Match or Any Match. Note
                that if you select All Match, all the conditions have to be true
                to evaluate the expression. On the other hand, if you select Any
                Match, at least one condition has to be true to evaluate the
                expression. Since we will configure only one condition, you can
                select any of them.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then you will see the system field and the custom field. Both
                the system field and the custom field contain initial fields to
                configure conditions. Of course, by clicking on the plus sign
                next to the system field and custom field, you can add more
                fields to configure conditions on them. Of course, you can
                remove the extra conditions by clicking the remove button.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now I will set a condition to see whether the system has the
                email address of the user or not. If the system has the email
                address of a user, the bot will inform the user that the updated
                information will be sent to the email address. On the other
                hand, if the system doesn’t have the email address of a specific
                user, the bot will ask for the email address from the user.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let’s set a condition to check if the system has the email
                address of a specific user or not and send messages accordingly:
              </p>

              <p>
                Add condition element and connect it to the new postback
                element. After that, click on the condition element to configure
                a condition. If you configure one condition, it doesn’t matter
                whether you select All Match or Any Match.
              </p>

              <p>
                Like before, select Email as the variable and Has Value as the
                operator. And click on the ok button. That’s all. The condition
                is set.
              </p>

              <img

              />

              <p>
                Now add two text element and connect them to the true and false
                sockets of the condition element. Now click on the text element
                connecting to the true element and write a text message to
                inform the user that the updated information will be emailed to
                the user.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then click on the other text element connecting to the false
                socket and write a message to inform the user that the system
                doesn’t have the email address, the bot can ask for the email
                address with user input flow.
              </p>

              <p>
                If the condition becomes true, the text message connecting to
                the True socket will be sent to the users whose email address
                the system alread has.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the other hand, if the condition becomes false, the text
                message connecting to the False socket will be sent. Now you can
                connect a user input flow message to the text element connecting
                to the false socket. The user input flow message will ask for
                the email address from the users and save it to the system or
                custom field variable.
              </p>

              </div>
              <p>
                To add sequence to the bot, first, go to the flow builder
                editor. The start bot flow component is already on the editor.
                Now add the trigger component, configure it and connect it with
                start bot flow component. Of course, you have to configure the
                start bot flow component. Then add a text, image, audio, video
                or file component and configure. In this article, I add and
                configure the text component. Now you have to add a button
                element and connect it with text element. To do that, Drag your
                cursor from the buttons socket from the text element and drop on
                the editor. Intstantly, a inline button component will be added
                connected with text element.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is an another way to add button component and connect with
                text element. To get inline button component, right-click on the
                editor and a list of different component will appear. Now select
                a inline button from the list and the inline button component
                will appear on the editor. Now connect the button element with
                the text element.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now you have to configure the button element. Double click on
                the button element and a sidebar called configure button will
                appear with two fields called button text and button type field.
                In the button text field, provide a name for the button. Then in
                the button type field, you have to select a button type from the
                drop-down menu. To create sequence message, we need a new
                postback component. Therefore, select a new postback component
                from the drop-down menu. Now click on the okay button.
              </p>

              <p>
                Instantly, a new postback component will appear connected with
                the inline button element. Now you have to configure the new
                postback component for the sequence. Double-click on the
                postback component and a sidebar called configure postback will
                appear with three fields called title, choose a label and choose
                sequence. In the title field, give a title for the postback
                component. And in the choose label field, select a label from
                the drop-down menu. In this case, you have to have a predefined
                label. Of course, you can create a label here. To create a
                label, write down the name of the label and press enter.
                Instantly, the label will be created and selected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you have to choose a sequence. Click on the choose sequence
                and a drop-down menu of different predefined sequence labels
                will appear. But if there is no predefined sequence, you have to
                create a sequence. To create a sequence, select the new sequence
                from the drop-down menu.

              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, you can add more sequence single elements to the new
                sequence element. To add more sequence single elements, drag
                your cursor from the next socket of the new sequence element and
                drop on the editor. Instantly, sequence single element will

                sequence in the sequence name field. Under the Sequence name
                field, you will see some time-related fields. In the starting
                time field, you have to select a time from the dropdown menu of
                different time. Likewise, in the closing time field, you have to

                sequence message will be sent to the users between the starting
                and closing times. And in the Time Zone field, select a time
                zone from the drop-down menu of different time zone. Now click
                on the ok button and the new sequence element will be set.

              <p>
                Now you have to configure the each sequence single element.
                Double click on a single sequence element and a sidebar called
                Configure new postback will appear with two radio buttons –
                promotional 24 Hours and Non promotional Daily. If you want to
                send promotional message, turn on the promotional 24 Hours.
                Instantly, a field called hours will appear. Now you have to
                select a time from the drop-down field. After selecting a time,
                click on the ok button. And the time will appear on the sequence
                single component. On the other hand, if you want to send
                non-promotional message, you have to turn on the radio button
                called non-promotional daily. And instantly, a field called days
                will appear. Click on the field called days and a drop-down menu
                of time frame of days will appear. Select a time frame from the
                drop-down menu and click on okay. And instantly, the time frame
                will appear on the Sequence single element. Likewise, you have
                to configure the other sequence single element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you have to give a title for each of the new postback
                elements connected with the single sequences.

              <p>
                Then you have to provide the final message. To provide the final
                message, you can add Text, Image, Audio, Video, File, Ecommerce,
                User Input Flow, or conditions. Just drag your cursor from the
                next socket of the new postback and a list of the different
                components will appear. From the list select a component and the
                component will be connected with the new postback component.
                After that, if you want to add more messages, you can add more
                components.

              <p>
                Now come to the broadcast component. Broadcast component and
                Action component is the same. The broadcast component is
                included here only to show you that you can set broadcast in the
                action component.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now let’s see how to create a campaign for broadcasting message.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, select a broadcast from the action field. Instantly some
                fields will appear. Now you have to fill-out the fields. Give a
                name for the campaign in the campaign name fields.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then provide labels in the Include label ids. The broadcast
                message will be sent to the people that are included in this
                label. Then provide a label in the exclude label ids. The
                broadcast message will not be sent to the people that are
                included in these fields.
              </p>
              <p>Then you can set the delay time in seconds.</p>
              <p>
                Then you will see a radio button called Sending time. By default
                is turned of. If you keep the button turned off, the broadcast
                message will be sent instantly. On the other hand, if you want
                to schedule the message, turn on the radio button.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instantly, two fields — schedule time and time zone — will
                appear. Now click on the schedule time field and a calender with
                date and time will appear. And from the calender, select the
                date and time you want to your broadcast message schedule on.
              </p>
              <p>Then select a time zone from the Time zone field.</p>

              <p>
                At the end of the form the targeted subscriber of the
                broadcasting message will be shown.
              </p>
              <p>Now click on the and the campaign will be created.</p>

              <p>
                After the time I have specified in the sequence single element,
                the message in the text element will be delivered to the
                subscribers.
