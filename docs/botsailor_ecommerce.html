                  >The Ecommerce store</span
                >
                is an eCommerce platform of BotSailor, a visual drag and drop
                Telegram bot builder platform. On the eCommerce platform, you
                can create an eCommerce store that could be available inside
                your Telegram Bot. if you integrate the eCommerce store built on
                BotSailor with your Telegram bot, they together can sell
                products to customers and take payment from them.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the Bot Sailor visual drag and drop bot builder editor, there
                is a component called E-commerce. And with the component, you
                can easily integrate the eCommerce store with a Telegram Bot.
                After integrating the eCommerce store with your Telegram Bot,
                they together will sell products to customers and take payment
                from them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just after creating your eCommerce store, it will provide you
                with two QR codes— a Telegram Messenger QR code and a browser QR
                code. You just have to supply the QR codes to your customers.
                Just as your customers scan the Messenger QR code, straightway,
                your virtual shop opens inside your messenger. Likewise, just as
                they scan the browser QR code, your virtual shop will open on
                their browsers. Because of the QR codes, your customers will get
                rid of finding your Facebook page, sending messages, and
                entering your virtual restaurant’s link on their browsers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides, the eCommerce store will provide two URLs under the QR
                codes--Telegram Messenger URL and browser URL. Just like QR
                codes, the Messenger URL will be opened inside the Telegram
                messenger, and the browser URL will be open on the browser.
              </p>

              <p>
                First, you have to create a store and add food items to the
                store. Then you have to make some settings so that your
                ecommerce store works properly.
                <br /><br />

                To create a store, go to the
                <span class="text-primary">
                  left panel of the BotSailor Dashboard > click on the
                  'Ecommerce store'

                menu. <br /><br />

              <p>
                Just as you click on the

                  >Ecommerce store option at the leftsidebar of the BotSailor
                  Dashboard</span
                >
                a page called Ecommerce store will appear with a
                <span class="badge badge-success">Create store</span> button at
                the top of the page. At the right top side of the page, you will
                see the name of your user id of your Telegram bot. There is
                another
                <span class="badge badge-success">Create store</span> button at
                the bottom of the page. To create an eCommerce store, you can
                also click on the button.

              <p>
                Well, to create a new store, you have to click on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Create store</span> button
                first. Instantly, a form will appear. You have to fill out the
                form-- selecting a Facebook Page, providing some initial
                information about the virtual restaurant, writing down the Terms
                of service and refund policy, and uploading the logo and
                favicon. <br />
                <br />

                In the form, there is a special box called local that needs a
                bit of explanation. Just as you click on the box, a drop-down
                menu of some languages will appear-- you can select any
                language. Your virtual restaurant will open in the language that
                you select. For example, if you select English, your virtual
                restaurant will appear to your customers in English.
              </p>

              <p>
                <img

                />
              </p>

              <p>
                There are two boxes called, ‘Facebook Pixel Id’ and ‘Google
                Analytics Id’ that also need a bit of explanation.
                <br />
                <br />

                Facebook Pixel Id is a piece of code you can place inside the
                source code of your website. The code automatically can collect
                and store data of your website visitors. Because of Facebook
                Pixel code, you can run Facebook Ads for targeted audiences who
                have visited your website before using the data. Please visit
                the
                <a
                  href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755?id=1205376682832142"
                  class="stretched-link"
                  >link</a
                >
                to see how to create Facebook Pixel Id. <br />
                <br />

                Google Analytics Id also works like Facebook Pixel Id to
                re-target your website visitors in the Google ads. Please visit
                the
                <a
                  href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009694?hl=en"

                  >link</a

                to learn how to create Google Analytic Id. <br />
                <br />

                Anyway, after filling out the form, click on the
                <span class="txt text-primary">Create store</span> button at the
                bottom of the form. If you fill up every compulsory field
                properly, a pop-up box will appear with a successful message.
              </p>

              <div class="section-header">

              <p>
                Now you have to add some categories to your store so that you
                can add food items in different categories. The category is an
                important thing to arrange your food items. If your food items
                are organized properly, your clients can look over different
                food items and choose from them easily. To add a category, click
                on the option called ‘Categories’ in the ‘Action menu’ at the
                right side of the Dashboard. Instantly, a page will appear with
                the <span class="badge badge-success">Add category</span> button
                at the top-right of the page.
              </p>

              <p>

                </span>

                <br />
                <br />

                Now click on the
                <span class="badge badge-primary">Add Category</span> button and
                straightaway, a pop-up form will appear. You have to fill out
                the form— writing down a Category name. Then click on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Save</span> button. Now this
                category has been added to your store.

                Of course, you can add as many categories as you want. And all

              <p>
                To add the attribute, click on
                <span class="text-primary"
                  >Attributes > Add Attribute > write down Attribute Name >
                  provide Attribute Value > Enable or Disable two radio buttons

                >
                <br />
                <br />

                Just as you click on the Attributes option in the Action menu at
                the left side of the dashboard, a page called ‘Attributes’ will
                appear with the ‘Add attribute’ button at the top-right of the
                page.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  class="img-thumbnail"
                  src="assets/images/ecommerce/Add attribute.png"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                Now click on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Add attribute</span> button
                and a pop-up box will appear. In the box, you have to write down
                the name of the attribute and give attribute values in
                comma-separated. Then enable or disable three buttons called
                ‘Multi select’, ‘Optional’, and ‘Active’ as you see fit for the
                attribute. <br />
                <br />

                By the <span class="badge badge-success">Active</span> button,
                you can make the attribute Active or Inactive. The
                functionalities of the other two buttons are a bit complicated
                to understand. If you enable the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Multi-select</span> button,
                your clients can select the multiple attribute values of the
                same food item. If you add an attribute called ‘Pizza toppings’
                and add three values like ‘Extra Chilly’, ‘Extra spice’ and
                ‘Extra cheese’ and turn on a multi-select button, your customers
                can order a Pizza that has Extra Chilly, Extra spice, and Extra
                cheese at the same time. <br />
                <br />

                On the other hand, if you disable the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Multi-select</span> button, a
                client can only one attribute value for a specific food item.
                For example, if you disable ‘Multi-select’ for an attribute
                called ‘pizza toppings’ with three values called ‘Extra Chilly’,
                ‘Extra spice’, and ‘Extra cheese’ a client can only order a
                pizza either with extra chilly, extra spice or extra cheese.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  class="img-thumbnail"
                  src="assets/images/ecommerce/attribute_box.png"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the multi-select button, you have to keep in mind that
                you can’t enable the multi-select button for the attributes like
                ‘Size’ because a food item can’t be small, medium, and large at
                the same time-- it is not logically possible. But you can enable
                the multi-select button for the attributes like toppings because
                toppings can have Extra Chilly, Extra Spice, and Extra Cheese at
                the same time. Moreover, for attributes like pizza toppings
                enabling the multi-select button is useful because then
                customers can order a pizza that has extra Chilly, extra spice,
                and extra cheese in the toppings at the same time.
                <br />
                <br />

                On the other hand, if you turn on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Optional</span> button, your
                clients can avoid selecting attributes for a specific food item.
                Then the clients can order specific food items that have no
                additional ingredients. For example, if you enable the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Optional</span> button for
                ‘Pizza toppings’, a client can order a pizza with toppings that
                has no extra ingredients. <br />
                <br />

                But if you disable the ‘Optional’ button, the clients must
                choose an attribute. Otherwise, he/she can’t order the food
                item. Disabling the ‘Optional’ button is required for attributes
                like size, for a client must select a value for size whether it
                is small, medium or large. Otherwise, they can’t order a food
                item.
                <br />
                <br />

                Then comes the ‘Active’ button. If you turn on the active
                button, the attribute will appear when you add a food item to
                the store and otherwise not.
                <br />
                <br />

                Like the Category option, after you have added one or more
                attributes, the attributes will appear on the page. Of course,
                you can add as many attributes as you want. Well, from the page,
                you can edit and delete any attribute you want and can see the
                status of the attributes.

                To add products, click on the ‘Products’ option in the ‘Action’

                add the product-- providing some initial information about the
                products, selecting categories and attributes. Moreover, you
                have to upload thumbnails and featured images of the products--
                you can upload one more image of the products in the featured

              <p>
                Now you have to make a checkout setting for your eCommerce store
                built on the Ecommerce platform of BotSailor. BotSailor’s
                ‘Ecommerce platform’ has integrated some online payment
                methods-- PayPal, Stripe, Mollie, Razorpay, Paystack so that
                your customers can pay via the payment methods easily. Besides,
                it supports manual payment and cash on delivery systems. <br />
                <br />

                Now you can make a specific checkout setting for a specific
                store.

                <span class="text-primary">Action > Checkout settings</span>

                To make a checkout setting, click on the ‘Checkout settings’ in
                the ‘Action’ menu at the left side of the store dashboard.
                Instantly, appear a form that you have to fill up. First, you
                have to provide your account information for any or some of the
                online payment methods that you want to enable. Then you have to
                write down the instruction for manual payment in the text area
                called ‘Manual Payment Instruction’.<br />
                <br />

                After that, you will get a checkout payment option. From here,
                you can enable any online payment methods and manual checkout
                for your store. And ‘Cash on Delivery’ is enabled by default.<br />
                <br />

                After that, you will get the ‘Currency and Label’ option. Here,
                you have to select the currency of online payment methods, the
                currency through which the clients will give the payment. For
                example, if you select USD(Dollar) for PayPal and Stripe, your
                customers have to pay in Dollars via PayPal and Stripe. Then you
                will see, in a row, three radio buttons called
                <span class="badge badge-success">Right alignment</span> ,
                <span class="badge badge-success">Two decimal</span> , and
                <span class="badge badge-success">Display comma</span>. By
                placing your mouse cursor on the tooltips, you can see the
                functionality of these buttons. Then you have to put labels for
                the <span class="badge badge-success"></span>‘Buy Now’ button
                and
                <span class="badge badge-success">Store Pickup</span>
                title.<br />
                <br />

                Then came the Tax and Delivery charge option. Here, you have to
                provide the amount of Tax in percentage and delivery charge.<br />
                <br />
              </p>

              <p>
                <img
                  class="img-thumbnail"
                  src="assets/images/ecommerce/screenshots of checkout setting.png"
                />
              </p>

              <p>
                Then comes the address preference area. At first, you see a
                radio button called
                <span class="badge badge-success">Store Pickup</span>. If you
                enable the button, the clients can give food orders via your
                virtual restaurant and receive food items sitting at the table
                of your real restaurant. But if you disable the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Store Pickup</span> button,
                you have to give a delivery address where the food will be
                delivered. Next to the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Store Pickup</span> button,
                you will see a button called
                <span class="badge badge-success">Delivery note</span> . If you
                enable the ‘Delivery note’, button, your clients will get a text
                area where they can write a delivery note. In the delivery note,
                they can tell you how they want the delivery. For example, he
                can tell that they want the delivery person to wear a mask while
                delivering the food.<br />
                <br />

                Then come some radio buttons, by disabling and enabling them,
                you can determine which piece of information your clients have
                to provide while giving their delivery addresses. The importance
                of the buttons is that most of the time, you don’t need the
                country, state, city, and country zip, because you already know
                the area of your clients. So you don’t need to bother your
                valued customers to provide his country, state, city and country
                zip you know beforehand. On the other hand, if you are uncertain
                of your customers’ area, enable country, state, city, and
                country zip so that they have to provide them. <br />
                <br />

                After filling out the checkout setting form, click on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Save</span> button and your
                checkout setting is set.

                Since you have enabled the store pickup option, you have to set
                the delivery points. To do this, you have to add point names and
                point details. As for a restaurant, delivery points would be
                table and point detail would be table number. To add a delivery
                point, click on the ‘Delivery points’ on the left side of the
                dashboard. Instantly, a page will appear with the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Add point</span> button at
                top-right position. Click on the button and a pop-up form will
                appear. Then you have to fill-out the form by providing
                point(Table) and point details (For example, Table 1).

                If you want to give discounts on some specific products, coupons
                are required.
                <br />
                <br />

                Well, to make coupons, click on the coupons option in the
                ‘Action’ menu at the left side of the Dashboard. And instantly,
                appear a form you have to fill out to create a coupon. At the
                products field, you have to specify the products the coupon will
                be applicable.

              <p>
                In BotSailor's Ecommerce platform, you can make three types of
                coupons, such as Percent, Fixed cart, and fixed products. Now
                you have to select any of the three types of coupon code. Before
                selecting, you have to understand the functionality of each type
                of coupon. <br /><br />

                Let's explain them: <br /><br />

                Percent– Percent coupon type is applicable for selected products
                only. For example, if the cart contains three (3) t-shirts @ $20
                each = $60, a coupon for 10% off applies a discount of $6.<br /><br />

                Fixed cart –A fixed total discount for the entire cart. For
                example, if the cart contains three (3) t-shirts @ $20 each =
                $60, a coupon for $10 off gives a discount of $10. This coupon
                type will be applicable for all the products you have added to
                cart whether you have selected the products or not.<br /><br />

                Fixed product – A fixed total discount for selected products
                only. Customers receive a set amount of discount per item. For
                example, three (3) t-shirts @ $20 each with a coupon for $10 off
                applies a discount of $30.<br /><br />
                Then you have to fill out the following boxes: <br /><br />

                Coupon Code- Now give code for the coupon. Your customers will
                use the code to get discounts on the products the coupon is
                applicable to. <br /><br />

                Coupon amount- Then you have to provide the amount for the
                coupon. Depending on the discount type you choose, the coupon
                amount will be a Fixed value or percentage. Enter the amount
                without a currency unit or a percent sign, which will be added
                automatically based on the discount type you choose e.g., Enter
                ’10’ for £10 or 10%.<br /><br />

                Coupon expiry date– Date the coupon should expire and can no
                longer be used.<br /><br />
                Max usage limit- You have to specify the number of times the
                coupon could be used before reaching the expiration date.
                <br /><br />

                Coupon deactivate- By disabling the
                <span class="badge badge-success">status</span> button, you
                deactivate the coupon anytime.<br /><br />

                Free shipping – If you enable Free shipping, the shipping cost
                will be removed when the coupon is used.<br /><br />
              </p>

                You can see the details of the orders given by your clients on a
                page called <span class="text-primary">Orders</span>. Most
                importantly, using a thermal printer, you can print the invoices
                for the orders easily. To see the details of orders and print
                the invoices, click ‘Orders’, in the ‘Action Menu’ at the left
                side of the dashboard. Without delay, all the orders listed will
                appear on the page. Move the bottom scroll bar to see the whole
                details of the orders. From the page, you can change the status
                of the orders. Click on the ‘Status’ field beside the specific
                order and a drop-down menu with ‘Pending’, ‘Approved’,
                ‘Rejected’, ‘Shipped’, ‘Delivered’, and ‘Completed’ will appear.
                Now you can select one of them to see the status of the order
                later.

                page, you will see three options — Large A4, Thermal 88mm,
                Thermal 57mm. Click on one of them and the print option will
                appear. After the invoice printed, give the copy to your cook.
                By clicking on the button called
                <span class="badge badge-success">Choose date</span>, you can
                see only the orders given at a specific time such as the last

              <hr />

              <p>
                If you make a setting, Confirmation and Reminder can send
                abandoned cart recovery reminders to the clients if they leave
                your virtual restaurant after adding food items to the cart. It
                is a very important feature because it can recover lost sales by
                bringing back the potential customers to your virtual
                restaurant. As well, the feature can send confirmation messages
                just as they finish purchasing so that the customers could be
                confirmed about their purchase.<br /><br />

                To make a setting, click on the ‘Confirmation and Reminder’
                option in the left menu. Instantly, appear a form you have to
                fill-out. At the top, you will see three options-- Messenger,
                Sms, and Email. Select Messenger to send Confirmation message
                and Abandoned Cart Recovery Reminder via Messenger and select
                Sms and Email respectively.<br /><br />

                Well, if you want to set the confirmation message for messenger,
                first, select messenger at the top of the form, and next, select
                ‘checkout messenger’ at the bottom-right of the form. After
                that, you have to write the content in the ‘messenger content’
                box. And the
                <span class="badge badge-success">My Order</span> button, the
                order page link embedded, will be automatically added to the
                confirmation message. That is, your clients will get the message
                along with the ‘My Order’ button. And clicking on the button,
                the client can see the order history. Of course, you can change
                the label of my order button.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Likewise, you can set confirmation messages for Sms and
                Email.<br /><br />

                On the other hand, BotSailor's Ecommerce platform can send three
                abandoned cart reminders successively within one hour to 24
                hours. And you can set each abandoned cart reminder differently.
                Like confirmation messages, to set abandoned cart reminders for
                messenger, first, select messenger at the top then select any of
                the messenger reminders. Then click under it and a drop-down
                menu will appear. From the drop-down menu, you can select the
                hour (from 1 hour to 24 hours) you want to send the reminder at.
                Of course, you can stop the reminder by selecting the ‘do not
                send’ option from the drop-down menu. <br /><br />

                You can edit or rewrite the content in the ‘Messenger content’
                box. <br /><br />

                The product link is embedded in a button called the
                <span class="badge badge-success">View Details</span> , the
                product link embedded and the ‘Checkout’ button with the
                checkout page embedded would automatically be added to the
                reminder. Of course, you can change the labels of the two
                buttons. By clicking on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">View Details</span> button,
                the client can see all the items added to the cart. As well, by
                clicking on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Checkout</span> button’, the
                clients directly enter the checkout page. You can also insert a
                coupon code, while editing the content, in the message box to
                give discounts on the products. <br /><br />

                If a client leaves your virtual restaurant and returns and
                finishes purchasing before an abandoned cart recovery is sent,
                the abandoned cart recovery reminder will be stopped
                automatically, and instead, a confirmation message will be sent.
                Likewise, getting an abandoned cart recovery reminder, if a
                client returns to your virtual restaurant and finishes
                purchasing, other recovery reminders in a queue will be stopped,
                and instead, a confirmation message will be sent.

              <p>
                Once you have finished creating your virtual restaurant, you
                need the QR codes to provide them to your clients-- scanning the
                QR codes, your clients can easily enter your restaurant not only
                via Facebook Messenger but also on the browsers. <br /><br />

                To get the QR codes, click on the QR menu and straightway, the
                ‘QR menu’ page will appear. On the page, you will see two QR
                codes-- one for messenger and the other for browsers. Clicking
                on the <span class="badge badge-success">Download</span> button,
                you can easily download the QR codes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  class="img-thumbnail"

                />
              </p>
              <p>
                Now print the QR code and attach it to any suitable place, for
                example, on the wall, and on the table so that your clients can
                easily notice and scan the QR code to enter your virtual store,
                meaning to get the virtual menu. Once the QR code is scanned,
                the virtual menu will appear on your mobile screen inside
                messenger or on browsers. From the virtual menu, your clients
                can choose foods and give orders while sitting at the table of
                your restaurant without talking to your waiter.<br /><br />

                In the COVID-19 pandemic, the QR code menu becomes essential
                because by using it, people needn’t come in direct contact with
                any person while eating out. <br /><br />

                Under the messenger QR code, you can write a welcome message for
                your clients. After writing the message, click on the
                <span class="badge badge-success">Save</span> button. Then your
                QR code will hold the message you have written.

                Once you finish creating your virtual restaurant, the ‘Ecommerce
                store’ has made different urls— Store url, Order url, Product
                url, and Legal url-- for your virtual restaurant. <br /><br />

                You need the urls if you want to integrate your virtual

                clients have to send messages to the Facebook page to get access
                to your virtual shop.<br /><br />

                To get the urls, click on the ‘Copy url’ option in the ‘Action
                menu’ at the left panel of the dashboard. Instantly, the copy
                url page will appear with four types of urls. You need the two
                types of url—Store url and Products urls-- to integrate the

                buttons. Select the web view full and a box called web url will
                appear— past the url here. If you provide a store url, the
                entire shop will appear inside the Facebook messenger, whereas
                for the product url, the specific product will appear. Clicking
                ‘Add more button’ and ‘Add more reply’ button, you can add more
